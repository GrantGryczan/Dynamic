# Miroware Dynamic
Create HTML5 animations with ease!

## Install this repository
Once you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, run the following commands to set up Dynamic.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GrantGryczan/Dynamic.git
cd ./Dynamic
npm install
```

## Run Dynamic from the repository
Once this repository has been installed, from within its directory, you can start Dynamic at any time using this command.
```sh
npm start
```
Of course, after any commits to this repository have been pushed, you can update your local copy of the repo using this command.
```sh
git pull
```

Note that Dynamic is currently under lots of development. It hasn't even reached version 1.0.0 yet! If you're expecting to be able to animate with it at this stage then you're far from right.

## Build Dynamic executables
Ha, even I don't know how to do that yet!
